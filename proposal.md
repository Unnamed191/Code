# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

2D flight fight Game (STG)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A simple 2d airplane breakthrough game, dodge barrage and shoot enemy airplanes. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a simple game, you can run it after clicking start, and then control your plane to fly up, down, left and right, launch barrage to solve the enemy and avoid the enemyâ€™s barrage.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not planning 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Yes, I think I can finish before the deadline

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope not so many bug for my game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
